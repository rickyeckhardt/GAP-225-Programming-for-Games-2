## Instructions
Download the Visual Studio solution below. Complete the tasks below by modifying the downloaded solution.


## PART ONE: PASSING UNIT TESTS
You are asked to implement the Vector2 and Triangle classes to pass all of the existing unit tests in Tests.h. In order to pass, your Triangle class will need to implement correct mathematical formulas. This may require some review or research of basic trigonometry on your part.

## PART TWO: WRITING UNIT TESTS
You are asked to add unit tests for a hypothetical Circle class. This class would implement the core features of a basic geometrical circle. Things you should test for include the radius of the circle, its diameter, its circumference, and its area. Again, you might have to review or research mathematical formulas in order to calculate the correct values to test against. You must write at least 10 tests.

Important
You do not actually have to implement the Circle class! You are only asked to write unit tests for it.

## TO IMPROVE YOUR GRADE
If you complete the requirements above to a high level of quality, you can add additional features as long as the following are met:

- They don't prevent the program from compiling or working correctly.
- They are related to the existing program.
- They are done to a high level of quality.
- They are commented and follow the coding standards.

Here are some suggestions for additional tasks for this assignment:

- Implement the Circle class so that it passes all of your unit tests.
- Add a feature to the Circle class that allows you to check if two Circle instances overlap.

## Purpose
Unit tests help you focus on the required features of your code and to have an accurate way to verify that they work correctly.
